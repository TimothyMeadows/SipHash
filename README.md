# SipHash
SipHash is a keyed, cryptographically-secure pseudorandom function (PRF) optimized for short inputs. It was designed by Jean‑Philippe Aumasson and Daniel J. Bernstein in 2012 to defend against hash-flooding (denial-of-service) attacks in hash tables. This version is also optimized for PinnedMemory.
